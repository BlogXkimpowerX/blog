["American Christianity Is Due for a Revival" by The Atlantic](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/american-christianity-can-still-come-back/ar-AA177LDK)


# Christianity

- People with "religious nones" had grown to nearly 30 percent of the population while Christian is around 63 percent, down from 75 only a decade ago
- The percentage of Christians plunges to less than half the population by 2070
- Is it inevitable that we will become an ex-Christian society?
- Why should anyone besides Chirstians like me care whether the Church revives?

## Thoughts
The answers to the above questions can be found in the article that I posted above.
This article was a very challenging article where it states the current state of Christianity and how it would go from this point.
And what would be the fix and revival for Christianity? The article also describes so many great points so I would recommend you to
read this article. One last thing is this article mentioned Korea and how it boomed for Christianity. 
And I am personally thinking this is the reason why Korea got blessed by God and it stands as one of the elite countries in the world.

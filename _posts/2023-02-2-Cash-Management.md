["CASH! A Modern User Guide" by AARP](https://apple.news/Aews_pM78SnqohapsVa_AMA)


Main points from the article:
  1.	Shows how to calculate your monthly cash needed and allows you to differentiate cash in different stages (daily, occasionally, and emergency)
  2.	This helps to decide how much side cash/emergency cash based on your current factors such as employment, age, dependents, and income stream.
  3.	Lastly, the article goes over the list of options to store your cash based on their yields and liquidity.


My View:

Today, I had a chance to read this feature story from AARP magazine which talks about how people should manage their cash depending on their situation. 
The article also provides a list of options (checking, high-yield saving, money market account, money market funds, CDs, Treasury bills, and Series 1 Saving bonds). 
First of all, this article makes me realize that I am a noob regarding with financial since those options are really new to me.

I would highly recommend this to others, but this is a magazine article that I cannot able to share via link. 
This article makes me realize that financial independence is not a simple road where buying a stock or having an estate but 
it is how to utilize your current resources to the maximum via many different methods this one particular shows how to manage your cash and then be able to yield interest. 
I will start thinking about this more and try to make a move similar to this method so that I could utilize more of my income instead of wasting it.

["Once Flush Savings Accounts Are Starting to Run Dry" by WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/once-flush-savings-accounts-are-starting-to-run-dry-11675691637)


Main points from the article:

  1.	Households amassed $2.7 trillion in extra savings by the end of 2021, according to Moody’s Analytics.
  2.	According to an estimate from Goldman Sachs. By the end of the year, the company forecasts that they will have exhausted roughly 65% of that money.
  3.	In 2020, they collectively saved 16.8% of their disposable income, well above the 8.8% they saved in 2019. But in 2022, the saving rate fell to 3.3%.


My View:

This seems to loop for the people in the US, especially lower-income people or people with existing debts. 
It feels like money comes in and then goes out without doing much for people’s finances. 
It feels like a zero-sum game where it returns to zero no matter what the result. 
Anyhow, people got extra buffer/cash in their savings but that is depleting very quickly, it won’t last for three years. 
I mean the government and institutions won’t last this any longer since they are losing money out of this.

This is my assumption and opinion so please be aware of what I’m going to say here. 
I will try to be radical about it, but this is not 100% factual so read it as a grade of salt. 

To my view, this is a total mass up of covering their “ass” for the government and Fed (Federal Reserve). 
I’m trying to point out here that the government and Fed decided to send money out to people with certain conditions during the unprecedented event (pandemic). 
However, this causes a side effect (inflation) and now they are taking away money from people to remediate this inflation. 
What is the point of giving out money in the first place if you are taking that money again? What in the world is this? 
The only thing I can think of is that the government is trying to show off without thinking thoroughly and then the fed is trying to recollect the mass here. 

But isn’t that the reason why government exists? To support people during this hard time? Then why they are trying to recollect the money? 
The short answer is Fed is not a government entity. The Federal Reserve is a commercial institution. 
They have no obligation to do such social work but only they are doing it for their “good deed”. And this “good deed” only works whenever their stakes are in good shape. 

There are many other reasons as well for this, but I do see that there is misalignment between two parties (Government and Fed) and this would keep coming no matter what unless one party gives in. 
We need to be more aware of this situation and protect our financial stands since the current system is not meant to do so in the first place.

["US to Postpone Blinken’s Visit to China Over Its Spy Balloon" by Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-03/us-to-postpone-blinken-s-visit-to-china-over-its-spy-balloon)


Main points from the article:
  
  1.	A spying balloon was found/loitering over Montana, home to intercontinental-ballistic-missile silos.
  2.	China claimed that this was civilian aircraft, and the purpose was to do climate research to pacify the tension.
  3.	The US decided to postpone the scheduled meeting with China. It was set to be the most senior US visit to China since 2018.


My View:

I guess the Cold War II is on the verge. The Winner of the Cold War, the US is not soon to be faced with the challenger, China. 
There have been some tensions between US and China in recent years (After Covid), and they are both participating in the power game. 
However, recently we got some news saying that China is losing its power/presence in the world due to its lackluster economy. 
And I assumed this would go down as a win for the US without any fightback from China.

And both countries are scheduled to meet, implying that China is reaching out to the US for a treaty, but now we have this news. 
It is so obvious and somewhat retarded move from China where they send this spying balloon loitering above US territory. 
And the finishing point here is that the area the balloon was loitering was the home of intercontinental-ballistic-missile silos in the US. 
China tries to pacify the US regarding this matter, but it's already done and gone.

We have to wait and see but to me, this ignites the timing bomb for China which would lead to an explosion to their face, and it is ticking way faster than they anticipated after this incident. 
It’s show time now, let’s have a seat and enjoy this show.

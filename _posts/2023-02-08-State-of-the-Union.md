["Three takeaways from Biden’s State of the Union address" by The Washington Post](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/3-takeaways-from-biden-s-state-of-the-union-address/ar-AA17edyB)


## Main points from the article:

  1.	Biden had a State of the Union address yesterday (2/7/2023) and discussed a couple of the topics including bipartisan, entitlement rights, debt deficit, and the Junk Fee Prevention Act
  2.	Biden emphasized bipartisan themes where he urged that both parties could settle on a consensus. He also mentioned the previous time when both parties (barely) agree to pass the infrastructure bill. 
  3.	Biden also emphasized on Junk Fee Prevention Act which cracks down on things like airlines charging fees for families to sit together, prohibiting high ticket fees for concerts and events, and preventing media companies from charging hundreds of dollars to customers who switch services.


## My View:

I didn’t watch the full version of this State of the Union speech from Biden last night. 
But I watched LeBron James's game which was the game in that he becomes the number one all-time scoring leader in NBA history. 

Anyways, this morning many news publishers published news about last night’s State of the Union speech by Biden and I found one particular bill that intrigues me when Biden mentioned it during his speech. 
Before I start talking about this particular bill, the overall theme of last night’s speech was bipartisan. 
The house is under Republican control and there are some important bills to pass on (Debt deficit increase, this one would be the battle to fight for each party) and without Republican votes, nothing can be moved on. 
So, Biden was emphasizing bipartisan consensus so that they could move on materializing the bills.

The rest can be found on the news if you are interested to know more about it. 
But the one thing that intrigues me besides anything else was the Junk Fee Prevention Act. 
This will remove all the side hustles that businesses are trying to sell to people. And why am I so impressed with this is that this would go against capitalism. 

We all know that the US is a head of capitalism where money can do everything. 
And business use that as a selling point to differentiate people by how much they can pay for such services. 
Now if this bill is passed, Junk Fee Prevention, businesses can’t easily charge people. 
There is a lot more to that since I didn’t read the full description of the law, but it would go against companies that are trying to charge more for such services.
I bet this would be another great fighting bill where Republicans and companies who are against this bill would tussle. 
And I’m not sure whether a bipartisan consensus would ever be possible with all these somewhat controversial.

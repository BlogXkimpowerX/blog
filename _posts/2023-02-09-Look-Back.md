## So far with the Blog:

I just post 10 articles excluding the intro on this blog. Among those 10 articles, most are related to tech and the economy. 
It seems like my preference is set to certain topics and from there nothing much new to discuss and share in this blog. 

I’ve been browsing through the news today and most of the new stories are somewhat similar to the one that I saw earlier. 
It feels like there is a broken record that keeps playing the same old lines of lyrics. 
And I was in this mode where I need to post something in this blog daily (It feels like I am doing a publisher job) and that keeps me in this box.

So, I am going to change things up in this blog. 
From now on this won’t be the place for a new recap but more of what I had and felt interested in certain stuff and have my own opinion about it. 
Therefore, this blog won’t be updated daily but whenever I have a topic or stuff to discuss it.

Stay tuned, and I will post something interesting hopefully this would give some more vibes to this blog. 
So far, it felt like this is more of a homework/report page than my own personal blog. And That is not what I want it when I started to do this blog.

["Home-Buying Companies Stuck With Hundreds of Houses as Demand Slows" by WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/home-buying-companies-stuck-with-hundreds-of-houses-as-demand-slows-11675739434)


Main points from the article:

  1.	Power buyer companies have hundreds of houses outstanding and causing huge cash flow issues for the power buyer companies.
  2.	Opendoor Technologies Inc. last year slashed prices on thousands of homes it purchased near the height of the market. The company reported huge losses and laid off 18% of its workforce.
  3.	Ribbon (the New York City-based startup that purchased homes with cash on behalf of buyers) has let go of about 170 employees or 85% of its staff, but it still needs to unload its surplus of houses


My View:

The housing market is going through a hardship right now. 
This is due to the recent hike in interest rates which causes mortgage rates to double compared to the pre-pandemic era. 
As a result, people are not shopping for a house nor not selling their home since the price would be slashed. 
However, this also affects the commercial side of the housing market where there are many startups and existing companies related to the housing market also got hit hard.

As the article from WSJ stated many startups and companies brought many houses to sell them with some fees to the buyers, but this business model hurt their cash flow nowadays due to current rate hikes. 
And those companies are either pausing their business or cutting lean to weather this economic downturn. 
Well, those companies' executives forecasted that there would be come back for the housing market, but it is not certain when would it be.

As I read through this article and saw another piece of news regarding the builders pausing home building due to lack of demand, it is too early to predict that the housing market would be rebound soon. 
Some articles say the housing market bottom is hit and it would tick back upward but as this article said the trouble is still lasting and we do not know when this would rebound it back. 
So, the only thing that I assure is there is a mixture of feeling going on and it could go in both directions for any reason. 
What I need to do for my own goal (buying a house soon) is to just get prep as soon as possible and then commit whenever there is a sign of opportunity.

["What Fed Interest-Rate Increases Mean for Your Mortgage, Car Loan, and Savings" by WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/interest-rate-increase-mortgage-loans-savings-fed-11675202043)


Main points from the article:

  1.	Fed is expected to hike the interest rate again by 0.25%.
  2.	However, this time the hiking rate is not much compares to the previous hike (0.50% ~ 0.75%).
  3.	Even though the inflation is cooling, and the interest rate hiking is minimal, you should reconsider your future finances accordingly.
  4.	With current interest rates, putting money in a saving account (currently, the Yields are around 3.3%) to defend from inflation and save for bigger purchases in near future.


My View:

Today’s topic would be a more of personal interest than any other topics that I shared in this blog. 
Briefly explain the article, where the rate hiking is minimal, and the inflation is cooling but the overall rate is still too high that we need to adjust our financial goals accordingly. 
Otherwise, we would be in top-notch debt due to these crazy interest rates. And one part that intrigues me is that hold on to big purchases such as a house. 
The article says current the market is not the best time to (house-wise and mortgage-wise) purchase a house. 
And right now, I am personally looking for a house that I can purchase but the more I look into it the more it tells or proves this article's point. 
However, the article also mentioned that we can’t time ourselves so don’t try to beat the market by timing your purchase.

What should I do now? Well just being pessimistic and complaining about the current market won’t solve anything. 
And as the article suggested, I should reconsider my financial strategy. 
For instance, I do have some money in the stock market that is waiting to be spent on home purchases but instead of leaving money in a volatile market put it somewhere more secure such as a savings account. 
Right now, in the current market, the saving account gives 3.3% interest on the money. What I’m trying to make a point here is that I need to be more active about the current situation since the world is not like any other past. 

I’ve mentioned this in my previous post where the world is evolving, and it is different from any other past. And that theme/idea also applies here as well. 
The old/past financial strategy is not working anymore, where there won’t be a low-interest rate nor a hot crazy stock market that goes above 50%. 
I have to find a way and make up the things. 

Thankfully, this article which was just the same old articles from the news media saying that increasing interest rates would do something but to me it was a wake-up call to get myself ready for the current market and work on my financial goals accordingly.
I don’t know whether this would gradually change me but at least it gives some idea, or I can say it ignites my financial goals endeavor.
